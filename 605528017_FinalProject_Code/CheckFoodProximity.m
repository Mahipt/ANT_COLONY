function [food_sources, indicator] = CheckFoodProximity(x, y, food_sources, food_proximity_threshold)
%{

functionality:
    compute the distance between the ant location and all food sources.
    find the nearest food source.
    if the distance is less than a threshold, remove that source from the
    foods list, and return 1. else, return 0.

outputs:
    food_sources: the (probably) modified list of food sources.
    indicator: 1, if the ant is near a food source, and 0 else.

inputs:
    x: the x of ant
    y: the y of ant
    food_sources: the list of food sources
    food_proximity_threshold: the threshold to determine proximity
